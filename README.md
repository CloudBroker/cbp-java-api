## About the CloudBroker Platform

The CloudBroker Platform is a web-based application store for the deployment and execution
of compute-intensive scientific and technical software in the cloud. It is provided as a cloud
service that allows for on-demand, scalable and pay-per-use access via the internet.

CloudBroker currently offers the platform as public version under
[CloudBroker](https://platform.cloudbroker.com), as
hosted or in-house setup, as well as as licensed software. This also means that the platform can
be run at different physical places and under different legislation, if desired.

## Requirements

* Java JDK 1.6 or later
* [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) build system
* [Ivy](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/) dependency manager
